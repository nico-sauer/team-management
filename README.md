Team Management project:

Our Goal: Make Sport Team Management easier By creating one Platform To all aspects.
Our "Team Management App" project is a tool for sport management team to manage every member/player of the team in some aspect (training, nutrition, physiotherapy etc.).
It also allows every player to manage his schedule and include all the components. 

Basic Features: 

- Create profiles/users based on role (Player, Coach, Physiotherapist, or Dietitian)

- View trainings, nutrition, and recovery plans

- Submit wellness and injury reports for medical staff to review 

- Access scheduled activities, appointments, and sessions

- Role-based access: staff members can assign, track, and adjust player programs

-----Admin -----
Before using the App set up 3 "Groups" in Admin panel:

1.Managers
2.Athletes
3.Staff 

To allow the manager register new team member (including himself) the "Managers" Group should include "Can add user" permission.
